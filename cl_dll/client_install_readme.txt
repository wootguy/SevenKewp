INSTALLATION
------------
1) Extract "valve_addon" to your "Half-Life" folder, usually found here:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\     (Windows)
   ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/                   (Linux)
2) Start the game.
3) Open the "Options" menu and go to the "Content" tab.
4) Enable "Allow custom addon content" then click "Apply"
5) Join a SevenKewp/Half-Life Co-op server.
   You'll know you're in a compatible server if you see name tags above player heads.

To disable the client, uncheck "Allow custom addon content" and click "Apply" again.

WARNING: USE CUSTOM CLIENTS AT YOUR OWN RISK 
--------------------------------------------
Executables distributed outside of Steam are subject to Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) detection.
Running this client may trigger VAC protections and result in a permanent VAC ban on your
Steam account.

That said, I have observed players using the HLBugfixed and Adrenaline Gamer clients for one
year on my secure server without them being VAC banned. According to my understanding of the
VAC documentation, executables need to be manually reported as a cheat to Valve for its
signature to be detected. I have not added cheats to this client. -w00tguy (2025/12/13)
